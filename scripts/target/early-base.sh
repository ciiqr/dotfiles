# Explicitly install kernel because I had a problem once right after re-installation where it was installed but seemingly the wrong version
# TODO: Maybe we just need to make the packages installed though d-i pull from the internet? (either remove local (to cd) repo entirely, or set some preseed option, idk...)
# NOTE: It seems the generic/server kernels are no longer different http://askubuntu.com/a/177643

# TODO: I should really change dotfiles to be handled like private-config so that I don't have to install git on all machines
	# This would also help because it would be one less thing dependent on the internet for the initial install (making or more likely we'll be able to pre-load all our packages to the iso when we generate it and install on machines without worrying about internet access for the initial install, though we'll probably still want to do an update in the firstboot script...)
